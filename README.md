# Mathematical-Modelling-in-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a report for the Machine Learning course, focusing on comparing the performance of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm on a given dataset. The report explores the optimal parameter settings for both algorithms and concludes with the selection of the best algorithm for the dataset.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis consists of 1400 samples, each having 25 features. The first column represents the sample ID, and the second column represents the label. There are five possible values for the labels, while the remaining columns are numeric features.

# Objective
The objective of this analysis is to compare the performance of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm on the given dataset. The specific tasks include:

1. Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.
2. Implementing the Random Forest algorithm using sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.
3. Optimizing the parameters of both algorithms to achieve the best performance.
4. Choosing the algorithm and its optimal parameter set based on the analysis.
